# 🧠 Stress Detection Using Machine Learning

This project detects whether a person is **stressed or not stressed** using Machine Learning and provides an interactive **Streamlit web application** for real-time prediction.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Stress is a serious mental health concern. This project uses behavioral, physiological, and lifestyle data to automatically detect stress levels using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

The dataset includes **Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores**, which are converted into binary stress labels.
